# Learning By Doing

Here is the tutorial ([Part I](https://auth0.com/blog/creating-your-first-elm-app-part-1/) and [Part II](https://auth0.com/blog/creating-your-first-elm-app-part-2)) where you can learn how to build web applications with [Elm](http://elm-lang.org/). If the learning curve in this tutorial is too steep for you, learn basics [here](https://guide.elm-lang.org/install.html).

In this code are used [Gulp](http://gulpjs.com/) (to build and serve application locally) and [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en) (to serve API and install dependencies through the Node Package Manager (`npm`))

## Steps

- [x] Setup Build Tools
  - [x] Create a `elm-package.json` and run `elm package install` in terminal
  - [x] Create a `package.json` and run `npm install` in terminal
  - [x] Create a `gulpfile.js` and fire up `gulp` task by running `gulp` in terminal
- [x] Create some helpers files
  - [x] Create a basic `src/index.html` file
  - [x] Create `src/styles.css` file
  - [x] Add folders `elm-stuff/*` and `node_modules/*` to `.gitignore` file
